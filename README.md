## PRIDE-PPPAR

PRIDE-PPPAR is an open source software package aimed at post-processing of GPS data.
We release this package with the hope to advance high-precision applications in 
geodetic and geophysical fields,
such as crustal motion and troposphere sounding studies.

PRIDE-PPPAR are available for:

* Different mode:  
    * Static, PPP float solution
    * Static, PPP ambiguity resolution
    * Kinematic, PPP float solution
    * Kinematic, PPP ambiguity resolution
* High-rate GPS data
    * 1Hz, 5hz, 10Hz    

`Notes: The phase clock/bias products, which are computed and released 
by Wuhan University in bias-SINEX format, 
are required by PRIDE-PPPAR.`
