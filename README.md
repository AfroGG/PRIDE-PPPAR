## PRIDE-PPPAR II

PRIDE PPP-AR II originates in Dr. Maorong Ge’s efforts on PPP-AR and later developed and improved 
by Dr. Jianghui Geng's team including Songfeng Yang. 
It is an open-source software package which is based on 
many GNSS professionals’ collective work in GNSS Research Center, Wuhan University. 
We would like to thank them all for their brilliant contributions to this software. 

No proprietary modules are used anymore in the software. 
We make this package open source with the goal of benefiting those professionals 
in their early career, and also advocate the geodetic and geophysical applications of PPP-AR. 
Especially, we hope that this package can contribute to 
high-precision applications in geosciences such as crustal motion and troposphere sounding studies. 
The entire open-source project is funded by National Science Foundation 
of China (No. 41674033 and 41861134009) and is under the auspices of IAG SC 4.4 
“GNSS Integrity and Quality Control”.

The phase bias products can be accessed at ftp://igs.gnsswhu.cn/pub/whu/phasebias/. 
Latest updates for Support, Training courses and FAQ can be found at https://pride.whu.edu.cn.

    11) GPS/Galileo/BDS-2/3 PPP-AR in the case of the bias-SINEX format phase biases (ftp://igs.gnsswhu.cn).  

`Notes: The multi-GNSS phase clock/bias products, which are computed and released 
by Wuhan University in bias-SINEX format, 
are required by PRIDE PPP-AR II.`
